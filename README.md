# CSCE 361 - City Traffic Simulator
* Team members:
    - Huy Vuong
    - Mohammad Majid
    - Bryan Chav√©z
    - Brian Nguyen

* Supervisor:
    - Christopher Bohn (professor)
    - Brian Chong (TA)
    - Patt Mann the Mayor

* Git collaborating:
    - DO NOT work and commit in the master branch, master should always works and only contains functional items.
    - For each time you want to make changes or contribute anything, create a new branch and submit your commits in there. I will try to review all the changes daily and I see your changes can be a good fit, I will merge it into master.
    - Creating a new branch can be execute as follows:
```
git branch new_branch                 # create a new branch
git checkout new_branch               # switch to new branch
git fetch 
```
* To push a new branch:
```
git push -u origin new_branch
```
* To merge a branch:
```
git checkout master
git merge branch_to_merge
git branch -d branch_to_merge
```
## Milestone
### Increment 1 : Analysis 
* An initial version of RAD is attached in Requirements directory

### Increment 2 : Object oriented Analysis and UML
* An initial version of Class and sequence digram
* Tools : [draw.io](draw.io)
	- Display  : (\*.png)
	- Editable : (\*.xml)
* Target platform : Web Application / Application
* Implementation language : Python, ~~Django (maybe)~~, ~~HTML~~, XML, UML


### Increment 3 : Design
* An initial version of Software Design Document is in the **Design** directory
* * Modules added ```numpy```
* Main frame prototype is added. Prototype right now is stored in **src** directory
    - If the user has all the requirements python modules, just simply double click **Simulation.py** (main method)
    - If the user unable to execute **Simulation.py** by double-clicking, just navigate to the **src** and execute
        - ```sh run.sh```

### Increment 4 : Object Design Development and Coding
* Class Diagram updated, some Sequence Diagram modified
* Program is stored in the src, structure are designed based solely on Object Oriented Paradigm
* A small testing framework, is set up for testing along with designing
* New modules added : ```pytest```, ```Pillow```
* Features developed:
    - Application is readable and usable as a GUI application.
    - Cars and City is viewable and understandable, car is able to move around the city when start button is triggered
* Try it!
    - Window Users: Simulation.exe is located in ```src/dist```
    - Build it your self: Build your own runnable by execute ```sim_build.c```    __Note__ : Some path in ```Simulation.spec``` will need to be modified
    - Downloadable content can be found at https://cse.unl.edu/~hvuong/traffic-simulation/

### Increment 5 : Coding and System Testing
* More code, implementations added
* `pytest` is used as a main frame for testing
* Modified __Breath First Search (BFS)__ is used to implement car path finding. Algorithm implementation is in `Map.optimal_path()`
* To run pytest : `py.test -v --doctest-modules test\_simulation\_data.py `
    - `-v` : A more verbose output
    - `--doctest-modules` : BONUS, flags for doctest in Python
