* Git collaborating:
    - DO NOT work and commit in the master branch, master should always works and only contains functional items.
    - For each time you want to make changes or contribute anything, create a new branch and submit your commits in there. I will try to review all the changes daily and I see your changes can be a good fit, I will merge it into master.
    - Creating a new branch can be execute as follows:
```
git branch new_branch                 # create a new branch
git checkout new_branch               # switch to new branch
git fetch 
```
* To push a new branch:
```
git push -u origin new_branch
```
* To merge a branch :
```
git checkout master
git merge branch_to_merge
git branch -d branch_to_merge
```
## Milestone

    - If the user has all the requirements python modules, just simply double click **Simulation.py** (main method).
    - If the user unable to execute **Simulation.py** by double-clicking, just navigate to the **src** and execute
        - ```source ./run.sh```

### Increment 4 : Object Design Development and Coding
